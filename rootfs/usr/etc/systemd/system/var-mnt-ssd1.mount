Description=Mount SSD1 to /var/mnt/ssd1
After=local-fs.target

# The mount information was discovered using the below steps:
#
# Find the block device that corresponds to the
# hard drive that you want to mount:
#
#  lsblk
#
# or
#
#  fdisk -l
#
# For me, the block device was sda1, I then needed
# the UUID of the block device, which I found by
# running:
#
#  sudo blkid /dev/sda1
#
# The UUID is then used below to tell `systemd` what
# you want to mount.
