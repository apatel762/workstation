# workstation

The operating system image for my workstation.

## bootstrap0

Assumption: brand new machine.

Install Fedora Silverblue:

- Download Flatpak
- Download Fedora Media Writer
- Flash Fedora Silverblue onto a flash drive
- Boot from the flash drive (Press F10 or similar during startup)
- Go through the installation wizard

**Important**: ensure that your username is `apatel`. There are a few things in the [dotfiles](https://github.com/apatel762/dotfiles) that depend on this (e.g. user profile picture).

Then follow the instructions in the [INSTALLATION](INSTALLATION.md) page to rebase onto this custom image.

## bootstrap1

Assumption: you have booted into a fresh installation of this custom workstation image.

### Password manager

Copy the KeePass database from another device to this device using an external hard drive (recommended). If in a pinch, send it to yourself on WhatsApp and download it via WhatsApp Web.

Set stricter permissions on the files as well:

```bash
chmod u=r,go-rwx Key
chmod u=rw,go-rwx Passwords.kbdx
```

(Permissions settings are likely not necessary but might as well do them...)

You must have the password manager on your machine in order to install the dotfiles. This is because the dotfiles need to lookup secrets.

### Dotfiles

Enter the [workspace](https://github.com/apatel762/workspace).

```bash
distrobox create --pull --image ghcr.io/apatel762/workspace workspace
distrobox enter workspace
```

The `chezmoi` app should be installed and ready to use. But first, in the KeePassXC GUI, find the SSH key entry and add it to the agent. (As of writing this, you just select the entry and hit `Ctrl+H`).

```bash
chezmoi init git@github.com:apatel762/dotfiles.git
```

TODO: next step is to set up GPG key. I think I finally need to confront the fact that I need to move files from my laptop to my new workstation.
