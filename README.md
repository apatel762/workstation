# workstation

The operating system image for my workstation.

## bootstrap0

Assumption: brand new machine.

Install Fedora Silverblue:

- Download Flatpak
- Download Fedora Media Writer
- Flash Fedora Silverblue onto a flash drive
- Boot from the flash drive (Press F10 or similar during startup)

Then follow the instructions in the [INSTALLATION](INSTALLATION.md) page to rebase onto this custom image.

## bootstrap1

Assumption: you have booted into a fresh installation of this custom workstation image.

Get `chezmoi`:

```
cd "$(mktemp -d)"
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)"
```

The binary will be downloaded to `./bin/chezmoi` (relative to your current directory). This is nice because you can delete it when you're done installing the dotfiles.
