[Back](../README.md)

Assumption: brand new machine.

## Backup

If you haven't done so already, you need to take a backup of your machine. Open the 'Files' window and open an external hard drives. Open another 'Files' window and open your Home directory.

Then, just copy folders over one by one until you've moved everything of value.

## Fresh installation

Install Fedora Silverblue:

- Download Flatpak
- Download Fedora Media Writer
- Flash Fedora Silverblue onto a flash drive
- Boot from the flash drive (Press F10 or similar during startup)
- Go through the installation wizard

**Important**: ensure that your username is `apatel`. There are a few things in the [dotfiles](https://github.com/apatel762/dotfiles) that depend on this (e.g. user profile picture).

Then follow the instructions in the [INSTALLATION](INSTALLATION.md) page to rebase onto this custom image.
